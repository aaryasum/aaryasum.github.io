I am a Course Assistant for **CS334: Robots and Art** in Winter 2026.

CS334 is an interdisciplinary, project-based course that explores creative applications of robotics at the intersection of engineering, art, and design. Students work in teams to conceive and build original robotic systems—ranging from interactive installations to performance-based projects—culminating in a public exhibition at the Stanford Robotics Center.
