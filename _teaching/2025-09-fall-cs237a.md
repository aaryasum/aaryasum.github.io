In Fall 2025, I served as a Course Assistant for **CS237A: Principles of Robot Autonomy I** taught by Prof. Mac Schwager.

CS237A introduces the core principles behind autonomous robotic systems, with a focus on motion planning, perception, state estimation, and decision-making for mobile robots. The course emphasizes algorithmic foundations alongside hands-on work using ROS, covering topics such as localization, SLAM, trajectory optimization, and learning-based perception.
