In Spring 2025, I was a Course Assistant for **ME314: Robotic Dexterity**, taught by Prof. Monroe Kennedy.

ME314 is a hands-on course on dexterous robotic manipulation, covering topics such as kinematics, motion planning, manipulator and gripper control, contact modeling, and grasp stability. The course combines perception and learning-based approaches with practical projects on real robotic manipulators, emphasizing contact-rich interaction.
