# Welcome
*Robotics · Manipulation · Perception · Learning*

Hi! I’m a second-year Master’s student at Stanford University focusing on robotics and automation. My research interests span robotic manipulation, perception, and robot learning, with a particular focus on contact-rich interaction and real-world robotic systems.

At Stanford, I have conducted research at the [IPRL Lab](https://iprl.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/), focusing on learning-based methods for robotic manipulation and perception. I have also worked with [Prof. Allison Okamura](https://profiles.stanford.edu/allison-okamura) in the [CHARM Lab](https://charm.stanford.edu/) on haptic interfaces and human–robot interaction.

Before Stanford, I completed my undergraduate degree at IIT Madras, where my research focused on assistive devices and mechatronic system design. Outside of research, I’m a member of [Stanford Counterpoint](https://www.stanfordcounterpoint.com/), an all-women a cappella group, and I enjoy playing the guitar and swimming.

If any of my work or interests resonate with you, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to chat!
